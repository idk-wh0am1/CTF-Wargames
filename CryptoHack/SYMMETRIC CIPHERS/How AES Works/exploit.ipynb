    "AES, like all good block ciphers, performs a \"keyed permutation\". This means that it maps every possible input block to a unique output block, with a key determining which permutation to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A \"block\" just refers to a fixed number of bits or bytes, which may represent any kind of data. AES processes a block and outputs another block. We'll be specifically talking the variant of AES which works on 128 bit (16 byte) blocks and a 128 bit key, known as AES-128.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same key, the permutation can be performed in reverse, mapping the output block back to the original input block. It is important that there is a one-to-one correspondence between input and output blocks, otherwise we wouldn't be able to rely on the ciphertext to decrypt back to the same plaintext we started with.\n",

    "# Resisting Bruteforce\n",
    "\n",
    "If a block cipher is secure, there should be no way for an attacker to distinguish the output of AES from a random [permutation of bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_permutation). Furthermore, there should be no better way to undo the permutation than simply bruteforcing every possible key. That's why academics consider a cipher theoretically \"broken\" if they can find an attack that takes fewer steps to perform than bruteforcing the key, even if that attack is practically infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "> How difficult is it to bruteforce a 128-bit keyspace? [Somebody estimated](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48667/how-long-would-it-take-to-brute-force-an-aes-128-key/48669#48669) that if you turned the power of the entire Bitcoin mining network against an AES-128 key, it would take over a hundred times the age of the universe to crack the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there is an [attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biclique_attack) on AES that's better than bruteforce, but only slightly – it lowers the security level of AES-128 down to 126.1 bits, and hasn't been improved on for over 8 years. Given the large \"security margin\" provided by 128 bits, and the lack of improvements despite extensive study, it's not considered a credible risk to the security of AES. But yes, in a very narrow sense, it \"breaks\" AES.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, while quantum computers have the potential to completely break popular public-key cryptosystems like RSA via [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm), they are thought to only cut in half the security level of symmetric cryptosystems via [Grover's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover's_algorithm). This is one reason why people recommend using AES-256, despite it being less performant, as it would still provide a very adequate 128 bits of security in a quantum future.\n",

    "To achieve a keyed permutation that is infeasible to invert without the key, AES applies a large number of ad-hoc mixing operations on the input. This is in stark contrast to public-key cryptosystems like RSA, which are based on elegant individual mathematical problems. AES is much less elegant, but it's very fast.\n",

    "At a high level, AES-128 begins with a \"key schedule\" and then runs 10 rounds over a state. The starting state is just the plaintext block that we want to encrypt, represented as a 4x4 matrix of bytes. Over the course of the 10 rounds, the state is repeatedly modified by a number of invertible transformations.\n",

    "\n",

The lookup table is called a \"Substitution box\" or \"S-box\" for short, and can be perplexing at first sight. Let's break it down.\n",

    "In 1945 American mathematician Claude Shannon published a groundbreaking paper on Information Theory. It identified \"confusion\" as an essential property of a secure cipher. \"Confusion\" means that the relationship between the ciphertext and the key should be as complex as possible. Given just a ciphertext, there should be no way to learn anything about the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a cipher has poor confusion, it is possible to express a relationship between ciphertext, key, and plaintext as a linear function. For instance, in a Caesar cipher, `ciphertext = plaintext + key`. That's an obvious relation, which is easy to reverse. More complicated linear transformations can be solved using techniques like Gaussian elimination. Even low-degree polynomials, e.g. an equation like `x^4 + 51x^3 + x`, can be solved efficiently using [algebraic methods](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/200617/how-to-solve-an-nth-degree-polynomial-equation/1078515#1078515). However, the higher the degree of a polynomial, generally the harder it becomes to solve – it can only be approximated by a larger and larger amount of linear functions.\n",

    "The main purpose of the S-box is to transform the input in a way that is resistant to being approximated by linear functions. S-boxes are aiming for high non-linearity, and while AES's one is not perfect, it's pretty close. The fast lookup in an S-box is a shortcut for performing a very nonlinear function on the input bytes. This function involves taking the modular inverse in the [Galois field 2**8](https://www.samiam.org/galois.html) and then applying an affine transformation which has been tweaked for maximum confusion.

    "# Diffusion through Permutation\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how S-box substitution provides confusion. The other crucial property described by Shannon is \"diffusion\". This relates to how every part of a cipher's input should spread to every part of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitution on its own creates non-linearity, however it doesn't distribute it over the entire state. Without diffusion, the same byte in the same position would get the same transformations applied to it each round. This would allow cryptanalysts to attack each byte position in the state matrix separately. We need to alternate substitutions by scrambling the state (in an invertible way) so that substitutions applied on one byte influence all other bytes in the state. Each input into the next S-box then becomes a function of multiple bytes, meaning that with every round the algebraic complexity of the system increases enormously.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An ideal amount of diffusion causes a change of one bit in the plaintext to lead to a change in statistically half the bits of the ciphertext. This desirable outcome is called the [Avalanche effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The *ShiftRows* and *MixColumns* steps combine to achieve this. They work together to ensure every byte affects every other byte in the state within just two rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "*ShiftRows* is the most simple transformation in AES. It keeps the first row of the state matrix the same. The second row is shifted over one column to the left, wrapping around. The third row is shifted two columns, the fourth row by three. Wikipedia puts it nicely: \"the importance of this step is to avoid the columns being encrypted independently, in which case AES degenerates into four independent block ciphers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/ShiftRows.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "*MixColumns* is more complex. It performs Matrix multiplication in Rijndael's Galois field between the columns of the state matrix and a preset matrix. Each single byte of each column therefore affects all the bytes of the resulting column. The implementation details are nuanced; [this page](https://www.samiam.org/mix-column.html) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_MixColumns) do a good job of covering them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/MixColumns.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We've provided code to perform MixColumns and the forward ShiftRows operation. After implementing `inv_shift_rows`, take the state, run `inv_mix_columns` on it, then `inv_shift_rows`, convert to bytes and you will have your flag.\n",
